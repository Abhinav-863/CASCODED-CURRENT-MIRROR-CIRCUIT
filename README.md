# CASCODED-CURRENT-MIRROR-CIRCUIT
A current mirror is a circuit designed to copy a current through one active device by controlling the current in another active device of a circuit, keeping the output current constant regardless of loading. The current being "copied" can be, and sometimes is, a varying signal current. Conceptually, an ideal current mirror is simply an ideal inverting current amplifier that reverses the current direction as well, or it could consist of a constant current source. The current mirror is used to provide bias currents and active loads to circuits. It can also be used to model a more realistic current source. In analog IC design, current mirror structure is one of the most used concepts.
